I am currently a **Visiting Student Researcher** at [Tsinghua University’s NICS Lab](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I work on **model-level optimization, sparse computation, and hardware–software co-design** to improve the efficiency of large-scale generative models.

I recently completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Science** at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), specializing in communication systems and machine learning. During my studies, I interned at the [Robust Scalable Systems Software Lab (RS3)](https://rs3lab.github.io/), working on **multimodal models for edge deployment**, and at [KAIST’s Concurrency & Parallelism Lab](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/), where I explored **processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators** for efficient large-scale language model inference.

I’m always happy to connect and discuss research — feel free to reach out!
