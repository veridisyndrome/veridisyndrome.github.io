I am currently a **Visiting Student Researcher** at [Tsinghua University’s NICS Lab](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I focus on **efficient AIGC**, **hardware–software co-design**, and **sparse computation** for next-generation generative models.  

I recently completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Science** at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), specializing in communication systems and machine learning. During my studies, I interned at the [Robust Scalable Systems Software Lab (RS3)](https://rs3lab.github.io/), working on **multimodal models for edge deployment**, and at [KAIST’s Concurrency & Parallelism Lab](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/), where I explored **processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators** for efficient large-scale language model inference.  

My research interests lie in **efficient deep learning, software–hardware co-optimization, and edge computing** with the broader goal of making large-scale models more computationally feasible and deployable. Beyond optimization, I am also curious about deeper questions in AI reasoning: how current systems fall short of human-like efficiency and intelligence, and what principles of cognition might guide models that **infer, learn, and generalize** more effectively.  

I’m always happy to connect and discuss research — feel free to reach out!
